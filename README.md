# Kadalamma Kalli 🌊🎯


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Tetris


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Safwan Muhammed - Cochin University of Science and Technology
- Member 2: Aditya Dev B - Cochin University of Science and Technology

### Project Description
An interactive, hyper-realistic seashore experience where you hand-draw text directly onto the coastal sand. A 2D silhouette boy sits faithfully on a rock on the shore counting each incoming wave, while Google Gemini Vision AI inspects your strokes in real time—the moment you dare write *"Kadalamma Kalli"* (Mother Sea, the thief), she takes offence and summons an unstoppable ocean wave that washes your writing completely away!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Going to an actual beach just to write names, poetry, or heartbreak messages into the sand is exhausting. Your footwear gets filled with abrasive sand, the sun gives you a harsh tan you never asked for, and waiting hours for real-world high tide to dramatically erase your dramatic words takes way too long.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A browser-based beach experience complete with realistic canvas sand trench physics, a 2D companion who counts ocean waves as they break, and cutting-edge Google Gemini Multimodal Vision AI. The instant you finish carving *"Kadalamma Kalli"*, Mother Sea herself is insulted and rushes in with a foamy tidal surge to wipe the sand completely clean!
